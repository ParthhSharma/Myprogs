# Comparison points is the total points a person earned.
#
# Given a and b, determine their respective comparison points.
#
# Example
#
# a = [1, 2, 3]
# b = [3, 2, 1]
# For elements *0*, Bob is awarded a point because a[0] .
# For the equal elements a[1] and b[1], no points are earned.
# Finally, for elements 2, a[2] > b[2] so Alice receives a point.
# The return array is [1, 1] with Alice's score first and Bob's second.
#
# Function Description
#
# Complete the function compareTriplets in the editor below.
#
# compareTriplets has the following parameter(s):
#
# int a[3]: Alice's challenge rating
# int b[3]: Bob's challenge rating
# Return
#
# int[2]: Alice's score is in the first position, and Bob's score is in the second.
# Input Format
#
# The first line contains 3 space-separated integers, a[0], a[1], and a[2], the respective values in triplet a.
# The second line contains 3 space-separated integers, b[0], b[1], and b[2], the respective values in triplet b.
#
# Constraints
#
# 1 ≤ a[i] ≤ 100
# 1 ≤ b[i] ≤ 100
# Sample Input 0
#
# 5 6 7
# 3 6 10
# Sample Output 0
#
# 1 1
# Explanation 0
#
# In this example:
#
# Now, let's compare each individual score:
#
# , so Alice receives  point.
# , so nobody receives a point.
# , so Bob receives  point.
# Alice's comparison score is , and Bob's comparison score is . Thus, we return the array .
#
# Sample Input 1
#
# 17 28 30
# 99 16 8
# Sample Output 1
#
# 2 1
# Explanation 1
#
# Comparing the  elements,  so Bob receives a point.
# Comparing the  and  elements,  and  so Alice receives two points.
# The return array is .
